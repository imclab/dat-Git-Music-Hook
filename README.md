##dat Git Music Hook ##

Append your most recently listened to track from Last.fm to your commit messages in git. Add that tune's hook to your githook.

I listen to a lot of music. Throughout my code you'll find random lyrics, and band names I've listened to. As a nice reflection (or zeitgeist of sorts), I thought it would be cool to add my track I'm currently listening to, to my git commit messages.

### How does it work ###

It works through the "commit-msg" githook. When commititing to your repo, it will query your recently listened to track from Last.fm's API and append it at the end of the commit message.

### Installing/Using "dat Git Music Hook" ###

Githooks are locally stored in each git repo under the .git/hooks/ folder. Copy the "commit-msg" file straight to that folder. Make sure the permissions are set to execute as well (chmod 755). 

Once copied, you will need to add 2 variables (LASTFM_API_KEY, LAST_FM_USER): an API key (gained from Last.fm: [http://www.last.fm/api/accounts](http://www.last.fm/api/accounts)), and your Last.fm username.

### Example use case ###

`git commit -m "Initial Commit"`

and it will automagically append it to something like this in your commit message:

`Date:   Thu Feb 21 10:38:58 2013 +0200

    Initial Commit
    - Listened to: Eskmo - Oh in This World of Dread, Carry On`

To not use the githook, simply add the "-n" or "--no-verify" flag to your commits. This will skip the "commit-msg" hook.

`git commit -nm "Removed ruby security lols."`
